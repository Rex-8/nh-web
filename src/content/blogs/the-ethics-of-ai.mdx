## Bias in Algorithms

Artificial intelligence, while powerful, is only as unbiased as the data it's trained on. This post delves into how biases can creep into machine learning models, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Understanding these pitfalls is the first step towards building responsible AI.

## Towards Responsible AI

Addressing algorithmic bias requires a multi-faceted approach, including diverse datasets, transparency in model design, and robust ethical frameworks. The NH-Web team is committed to exploring and promoting ethical AI practices in all our projects.

### Key Considerations:
- Data collection and representation
- Algorithmic fairness metrics
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Regulatory frameworks
