## The Data in the Cosmos

Astrophotography is not just about beautiful images; it's also about capturing vast amounts of data. This post explores how data science techniques, particularly machine learning, can enhance image processing, identify celestial objects, and even uncover new phenomena.

## Tools and Techniques

From Python libraries like `Astropy` and `OpenCV` to advanced neural networks, the possibilities are endless. We look at how different algorithms can be applied to stack images, reduce noise, and extract meaningful insights from raw astronomical data.

### Future Explorations:
- AI-driven object detection
- Automated galaxy classification
- Predictive models for atmospheric conditions
- Large-scale dataset analysis of celestial surveys
