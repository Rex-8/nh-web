## The Challenge

Classifying galaxies can be a tedious and time-consuming task for astronomers. This project aims to automate that process using cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

### Our Approach

We're utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of classified galaxy images from public astronomy archives. The model is being developed in Python using TensorFlow.
